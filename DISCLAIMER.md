# MC20 Series Respirator Open Source Prototype Project

Thank you for requesting a sample of our respirator and for your interest in our open source project. Our hope is to provide a necessary product at a time when it is in demand and to further improve this product by welcoming feedback. We encourage public contribution of ideas and expertise in order to create an open source standard that can be evaluated and approved.

## Notes

We are still working on improving both the filter and filter replacement method. We have inquired about a manufactured filter that will meet desired standards and be easier to replace. An open source 55mm and 80mm round filter would be a generic design that could be made by any manufacturer and fit in any respirator that supports such a standard. Currently, the respirator cap has to be tightened carefully to avoid wrinkling the filter material. It is possible a future design would not need the retaining grid on the filter body if the filter was able to retain its shape without it.

These respirator caps and bodies were printed with Polymax PC, Polylite CC, or Ultimaker PC. We would expect that all tape, padding, and filter material be thrown away after each use. The polycarbonate can be cleaned with soap and water, hot water, chlorine-based cleaners, or alcohol. Do not use a high-PH cleaner like lye or ammonia. Whatever cleaner is used, it is important to make sure the cleaner is safe for humans. In addition, the polycarbonate must be properly rinsed.
